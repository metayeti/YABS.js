![YABS.js](/logo.png?raw=true)

YABS.js is a lightweight JavaScript build system.

( **Currently in development** -- NOT production ready )

## Prerequisites

- [uglify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js) ( install with "npm -g install uglify-js" )
- [preprocessor.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preprocessor) ( install with "npm -g install preprocessor" ) - only needed if the build leverages the preprocessor


## How it works

YABS.js takes a single JSON file containing the build instructions as an input. It then verifies, prepares and invokes the build process.

## Minimal example
