PREREQUISITES
-------------

To start with, you will need node.js. Download and install from https://nodejs.org/.

To use YABS.js, you will need the uglify-js package. Install via command line using:

  npm -g install uglify-js

To build some of the examples that use the preprocessor, you will also need the
MetaScript package. Install using:

  npm -g install metascript

You should now be able to build from the command line.



I. BUILD EVERYTHING AT ONCE
---------------------------

If you just want to build everything and be done with it, use:

  node yabs.js

This will:
  - build yabs.js and output build.js.
  - build all examples and output them into build/examples/.
  - build all tests and output them into build/tests/.

 

II. BUILD YABS.JS
-----------------

To build yabs.js only, use:

  node yabs.js build_yabs.json

This will build yabs.js and output build.js.



III. BUILD ALL EXAMPLES
-----------------------

To build all examples, use:

  node yabs.js examples

This will build all examples and output them into build/examples/.



IV. BUILD ALL TESTS
------------------

To build all tests, use:

  node yabs.js tests

This will build all tests and output them into build/tests/.



V. BUILD A SPECIFIC TEST OR  EXAMPLE
------------------------------------

To build a specific example, use:

  node yabs.js examples/{example_name}

Similarly, to build a specific test, use:

  node yabs.js test/{test_name}

For example, to build the "minimal" example, use:

  node yabs.js examples/minimal

This will build the "minimal" example and output it into build/examples/minimal.
